#WSO2 Dev Box

Eventually going to add as many of the applications as I can.

It downloads:

- Java
- Maven
- ActiveMQ
- All WSO2 Products, comment out those you don't need

##Active Application Services

All can be stopped, started and restarted

`sudo service wso2am restart`
`sudo service wso2brs stop`
etc...

- Api Manager is a service
- BAM is broken currently
- DSS
- BRS
